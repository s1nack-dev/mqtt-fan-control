#  CEILING FAN MQTT CONTROL #


Control your ceiling fans via MQTT


:::CLIENT INFO:::


You must have mosquitto installed on the server running the fan-control code.
*sudo apt-get install mosquitto*


Make sure python3 is installed.

Make pip3 is installed: 
*sudo apt-get install python3-pip*

Make sure that gpiozero, rpi.gpio and paho-mqtt are installed via pip3
*sudo pip3 install gpizero rpi.gpio paho-mqtt*

To execute fan-control.py, run it:
```/usr/bin/python3 fan-control.py```

To start quietly in the backgroup, use:
```nohup /usr/bin/python3 ./fan-control.py &```

Also, to have the script run at boot, I created a System Service. See fancontrol.service

Add file to /etc/systemd/system/ directory

Then run ```sudo systemctl enable fancontrol.service```

Currently having issues with not connecting to broker as service. Possibly due
to the slowness of the raspberry pi 1. Need to investigate. 

```pi@raspberrypi:~ $ systemctl status fancontrol.service
‚óè fancontrol.service - Fan Control Python Script

```
If I manually run ```sudo systemctl start fancontrol.service``` it will load fine...

:::BROKER INFO:::

on the broker(the machine giving the orders), you must have mosquitto-clients installed
*sudo apt-get install mosquitto-clients*

from broker, you can run this command to send signal/message to the pi running fan-control.py

```mosquitto_pub -h 10.0.201.101 -t pizza -k 60 -m "living room fan low"```

Don't forget firewall rules. TCP 1883
